## 1. Licensing

### How is Opencomply licensed?

Opencomply is licensed under version 1.1 of the Business Source License (BSL), a source-available license that allows copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use under certain conditions. This enables our community to use our source code for a wide range of purposes while preventing commercially competitive use of Opencomply’s paid version of the Licensed Work.

### What’s the difference between the BSL and other licenses (AGPL, SSPL, Common Clause)?

- **BSL**: Highly permissive, allowing copy, modification, and redistribution under broad conditions. It is also time-limited; after a specified period (for Opencomply, 4 years), the code becomes available under an open-source license (MPL 2.0).
- **AGPL/SSPL**: Impose stronger copyleft requirements and can be more burdensome for commercial use.
- **Common Clause**: Restricts commercial offerings in different ways.

Opencomply believes the BSL strikes the best balance between making source code broadly available, supporting a community with minimal limitations, and protecting our ability to continue investing in feature-rich software.

### If I modify the source code of software licensed under the BSL, can I redistribute my modified version under another license?

No. Your modified version contains both the original BSL-licensed software and your modifications. Together, they constitute a derivative work of the original software. The BSL does not grant you the right to relicense the original code under a different license.

## 2. Competitive Offerings

### What is a “competitive offering” under the BSL license?

A **competitive offering** is any product sold to third parties—including paid support—that significantly overlaps the capabilities of Opencomply’s paid version of the Licensed Work. For instance, hosting or embedding an Opencomply product in a solution sold competitively against our commercial edition would be considered a competitive offering. Products not sold or supported on a paid basis are generally not considered competitive.

If you need further clarification regarding a specific use case, please email [licensing@opencomply.io](mailto:licensing@opencomply.io). Custom licensing terms may be available to enable use cases beyond the BSL limitations.

### What is considered a “paid support arrangement”?

Any arrangement where a user has a paying relationship with a provider who offers support for the Licensed Work—whether the Licensed Work is embedded or hosted—qualifies as a paid support arrangement. For example, offering the Licensed Work for free but charging for support as part of a broader services package is considered a paid support arrangement.

### What does “embedded” mean under the BSL license?

**Embedded** refers to including source code or executable code from the Licensed Work in a competitive product or packaging the competitive product in a way that requires an Opencomply product to be accessed or downloaded for the competitive product to operate.

For example, if a compliance service invokes Opencomply software as part of a managed service or through a container mechanism, that would be considered embedding. If the competitive product is invoking or executing the Opencomply product as part of its operation, it falls under the definition of “embedded.”

## 3. Professional Services & Internal Use

### Can I provide professional services around Opencomply?

Yes. You may offer consulting and professional services to help others deploy, manage, and operate Opencomply internally. The BSL only prevents embedding or hosting Community editions in a way that competes directly with our commercial products.

### Can I host Opencomply as a service internal to my organization?

Yes. The BSL allows for all non-production and production usage, except when it involves providing a competitive offering. Hosting Opencomply internally—within a single organization, including affiliates under common control—is fully permitted.
